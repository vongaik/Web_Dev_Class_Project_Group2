          <div class="ksuimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p>Organizations at Kennesaw State University actively participate in and contribute to a vibrant university community.  Approximately 300 Registered Student Organizations (RSOs) at KSU provide transformative experiences and opportunities for students to grow as individuals, leaders, and community members.</p>
          <p>Research has shown that students who are involved on campus are more likely to be successful and to gain more from their time in college (Astin, 1984).  Accordingly, student organizations provide opportunities to gain valuable experience in the practical aspects of leadership, communication, risk management, and teamwork. As such, student engagement in clubs and organizations are an important component to campus life at KSU that provide an outlet for the student voice to be heard and a vehicle for students to have a substantial impact on campus.</p>
